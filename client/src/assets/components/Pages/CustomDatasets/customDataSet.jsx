      <h1 className="page-title">05. Custom Datasets</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          In the last notebook (Notebook 03), we learned how to build computer
          vision models using PyTorch's built-in <b>FashionMNIST</b> dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          The steps we followed are common in many machine learning problems:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Find a dataset</li>
          <li>Convert the data into numbers</li>
          <li>Build or use a model to find patterns and make predictions</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          While PyTorch offers many built-in datasets for machine learning
          tasks, youâ€™ll often need to use your own custom dataset.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a custom dataset?</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            A <b>custom dataset</b> is a set of data related to the specific
            problem you're working on.
          </p>

          <p>It can be made up of almost anything. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you're building a food image classification app like{" "}
              <b>Nutrify</b>, the dataset could be food images.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're working on a model to detect positive or negative text
              reviews, the dataset could be customer reviews and their ratings.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're building a sound classification app, the dataset could
              be sound samples with their labels.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you're creating a recommendation system, the dataset could
              include examples of products that customers have purchased.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <img src={Custom} className="centered-image" />

        <p>
          PyTorch has built-in functions for loading custom datasets using
          libraries like <b>TorchVision</b>, <b>TorchText</b>, <b>TorchAudio</b>
          , and <b>TorchRec</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But sometimes, these functions might not be enough for your specific
          needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          In that case, you can create your own dataset by subclassing{" "}
          <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> and customizing it however you
          like.
        </p>

        <h2>What we are going to cover</h2>

        <p>
          We're going to apply the PyTorch workflow from notebook 01 and
          notebook 02 to a computer vision problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of using an in-built PyTorch dataset, we'll be using our own
          dataset of pizza, steak, and sushi images.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is to load these images and then build a model to train and
          predict on them.
        </p>

        <img src={dataload} className="centered-image" />

        <p>
          What we're going to build: We'll use <b>torchvision.datasets</b> as
          well as our own custom <code>Dataset</code> class to load images of
          food, and then we'll build a PyTorch computer vision model to classify
          them.

        <p>
          And like any good cooking show, some data has already been prepared
          for us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're going to start small, because we're not looking to train the
          biggest model or use the biggest dataset yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Machine learning is an iterative process: start small, get something
          working, and increase when necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          The data we're going to be using is a subset of the <b>Food101</b>{" "}
          dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Food101</b> is a popular computer vision benchmark, containing
          1,000 images of 101 different kinds of foods, totaling 101,000 images
          (75,750 train and 25,250 test).
        </p>

        <p>Can you think of 101 different foods?</p>

        <p>Can you think of a computer program to classify 101 foods?</p>

        <p>I can. A machine learning model!</p>

        <p>
          Specifically, a PyTorch computer vision model, as we covered in
          notebook 03.
        </p>

        <p>
          But instead of 101 food classes, we're going to start with 3: pizza,
          steak, and sushi.
        </p>

        <p>
          And instead of 1,000 images per class, we're going to start with a
          random 10% (start small, increase when necessary).

        <p>Time to become one with it.</p>

        <p>This is another important step before building a model.</p>
        <p>
          Data preparation is crucial. Before building a model, become one with
          the data. Ask: What am I trying to do here?{" "}
          <i>Source: @mrdbourke Twitter</i>.
        </p>

        <p>What does inspecting the data and becoming one with it mean?</p>

        <p>
          Before starting a project or building a model, it's important to
          understand the data you're working with.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our case, we have images of pizza, steak, and sushi in standard
          image classification format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The image classification format organizes images into separate
          directories named after each class.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, all images of pizza are stored in the <code>pizza/</code>{" "}
          directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          This format is common across many image classification benchmarks,
          including ImageNet (one of the most popular computer vision benchmark
          datasets).
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see an example of the storage format below. The image numbers
          are arbitrary.
        </p>
        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`pizza_steak_sushi/ <- overall dataset folder

        <p>
          The goal will be to take this data storage structure and turn it into
          a dataset usable with PyTorch.

        <p>Excellent!</p>

        <p>
          It looks like we've got about 75 images per training class and 25
          images per testing class.
        </p>

        <p>That should be enough to get started.</p>

        <p>
          Remember, these images are subsets of the original Food101 dataset.
        </p>

        <p>You can see how they were created in the data creation notebook.</p>

          <li>
            Pick a random image path using Python's <code>random.choice()</code>

          <li>
            Get the image class name using <code>pathlib.Path.parent.stem</code>

          <li>
            Since we're working with images, open the random image path using{" "}

            Turn it into tensors (numerical representations of our images).
          </li>

            Turn it into a <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> and

            these <b>Dataset</b> and <b>DataLoader</b> for short.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There are several different kinds of pre-built datasets and dataset
          loaders for PyTorch, depending on the problem you're working on.

        <p>
          Since we're working with a vision problem, we'll be looking at{" "}
          <code>torchvision.datasets</code> for our data loading functions as
          well as <code>torchvision.transforms</code> for preparing our data.
        </p>

        <p>Let's import some base libraries.</p>
        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms`}
        />

        <h2>Transforming data with torchvision.transforms</h2>
        <p>
          We've got folders of images, but before we can use them with PyTorch,
          we need to convert them into tensors.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the ways we can do this is by using the{" "}
          <code>torchvision.transforms</code> module.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>torchvision.transforms</code> contains many pre-built methods
          for formatting images, turning them into tensors, and even
          manipulating them for data augmentation (the practice of altering data
          to make it harder for a model to learn, which we'll explore later on).
        </p>

        <p>
          To get experience with <code>torchvision.transforms</code>, let's
          write a series of transform steps that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Resize the images using <code>transforms.Resize()</code> (from about
            512x512 to 64x64, the same shape as the images on the CNN Explainer
            website).
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip our images randomly on the horizontal using{" "}
            <code>transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip()</code> (this could be
            considered a form of data augmentation because it will artificially
            change our image data).
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn our images from a PIL image to a PyTorch tensor using{" "}
            <code>transforms.ToTensor()</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We can compile all of these steps using{" "}
          <code>torchvision.transforms.Compose()</code>.
        </p>
        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`# Write transform for image
data_transform = transforms.Compose([
    # Resize the images to 64x64
    transforms.Resize(size=(64, 64)),
    # Flip the images randomly on the horizontal
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5), # p = probability of flip, 0.5 = 50% chance
    # Turn the image into a torch.Tensor
    transforms.ToTensor() # this also converts all pixel values from 0 to 255 to be between 0.0 and 1.0 
])`}
        />

        <p>
          Now we've got a composition of transforms, let's write a function to
          try them out on various images.
        </p>
        <CodeIOBlock

        <p>Nice!</p>

        <p>
          We've now got a way to convert our images to tensors using{" "}
          <code>torchvision.transforms</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can also manipulate their size and orientation if needed (some
          models prefer images of different sizes and shapes).
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally, the larger the shape of the image, the more information a
          model can recover.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, an image of size <code>[256, 256, 3]</code> will have 16x
          more pixels than an image of size <code>[64, 64, 3]</code> (
          <code>(256*256*3)/(64*64*3)=16</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the tradeoff is that more pixels require more computations.
        </p>

          Alright, time to turn our image data into a Dataset capable of being
          used with PyTorch.

          Our images are now in the form of a tensor (with shape{" "}

        <p>How about we plot a single image tensor using matplotlib?</p>

        <p>
          We'll first have to permute (rearrange the order of its dimensions) so
          it's compatible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now our image dimensions are in the format CHW (color channels,
          height, width) but matplotlib prefers HWC (height, width, color
          channels).

        <img src={bigpizza} className="centered-image" />
        <p>Notice the image is now more pixelated (less quality).</p>

        <p>This is due to it being resized from 512x512 to 64x64 pixels.</p>

        <p>
          The intuition here is that if you think the image is harder to
          recognize what's going on, chances are a model will find it harder to
          understand too.

        <h2>4.1 Turn loaded images into DataLoader's</h2>
        <p>
          We've got our images as PyTorch Datasets, but now let's turn them into
          DataLoaders.

        <p>
          We'll do so using <code>torch.utils.data.DataLoader</code>.

        <p>
          Turning our Datasets into DataLoaders makes them iterable, so a model
          can learn the relationships between samples and targets (features and
          labels).
        </p>

        <p>
          To keep things simple, we'll use <code>batch_size=1</code> and{" "}

        <p>
          What's <code>num_workers</code>?
        </p>

        <p>Good question.</p>

        <p>
          It defines how many subprocesses will be created to load your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think of it like this: the higher <code>num_workers</code> is set to,
          the more compute power PyTorch will use to load your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Personally, I usually set it to the total number of CPUs on my machine
          via Python's <code>os.cpu_count()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This ensures the DataLoader recruits as many cores as possible to load
          data.

        </p>

        <p>Or one for your specific problem didn't exist?</p>

        <p>Well, you could build your own.</p>

        <p>
          But wait, what are the pros and cons of creating your own custom way

          To see this in action, let's work towards replicating{" "}
          <code>torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder()</code> by subclassing{" "}
          <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> (the base class for all
          Dataset's in PyTorch).
        </p>

        <p>We'll start by importing the modules we need:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Python's <code>os</code> for dealing with directories (our data is
            stored in directories).
          </li>
          <li>
            Python's <code>pathlib</code> for dealing with filepaths (each of
            our images has a unique filepath).
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>torch</code> for all things PyTorch.
          </li>
          <li>
            PIL's <code>Image</code> class for loading images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> to subclass and create our own
            custom Dataset.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>torchvision.transforms</code> to turn our images into tensors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Various types from Python's <code>typing</code> module to add type
            hints to our code.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div className="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong>
          You can customize the following steps for your own dataset. The

        <h2>5.1 Creating a helper function to get class names</h2>

        <p>
          Let's write a helper function capable of creating a list of class
          names and a dictionary of class names and their indexes given a
          directory path.
        </p>

        <p>To do so, we'll:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Get the class names using <code>os.scandir()</code> to traverse a
            target directory (ideally the directory is in standard image
            classification format).
          </li>
          <li>
            Raise an error if the class names aren't found (if this happens,
            there might be something wrong with the directory structure).
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the class names into a dictionary of numerical labels, one for
            each class.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Let's see a small example of step 1 before we write the full function.
        </p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`# Setup path for target directory
target_directory = train_dir
print(f"Target directory: {target_directory}")

print(f"Class names found: {class_names_found}")`}
          outputCode={`Target directory: data/pizza_steak_sushi/train

        <h2>5.2 Create a custom Dataset to replicate ImageFolder</h2>
        <p>Now we're ready to build our own custom Dataset.</p>

        <p>
          We'll build one to replicate the functionality of{" "}
          <code>torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will be good practice, plus, it'll reveal a few of the required

        <p>It'll be a fair bit of code... but nothing we can't handle!</p>

        <p>Let's break it down:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subclass <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Initialize our subclass with a <code>targ_dir</code> parameter (the
            target data directory) and <code>transform</code> parameter (so we
            have the option to transform our data if needed).
          </li>
          <li>
            Create several attributes for paths (the paths of our target
            images), transform (the transforms we might like to use, this can be
            None), classes and class_to_idx (from our{" "}
            <code>find_classes()</code> function).
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a function to load images from file and return them, this
            could be using PIL or <code>torchvision.io</code> (for input/output
            of vision data).
          </li>
          <li>
            Overwrite the <code>__len__</code> method of{" "}
            <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code> to return the number of
            samples in the Dataset, this is recommended but not required. This
            is so you can call <code>len(Dataset)</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overwrite the <code>__getitem__</code> method of{" "}

        <p>
          Now, before we test our new <code>ImageFolderCustom</code> class,

        <p>
          Letâ€™s turn our training images (from <code>train_dir</code>) and
          testing images (from <code>test_dir</code>) into Datasets using our

        <p>
          Looks like our <code>ImageFolderCustom</code> is working just the way
          we want it to.
        </p>

        <h2>Turn custom loaded images into DataLoader's</h2>
        <p>

          (features mapped to labels or X's mapped to y's) using our{" "}

        <p>
          Now how can we turn these custom <code>Dataset</code>'s into{" "}

          If you guessed by using <code>torch.utils.data.DataLoader()</code>,
          you're right!
        </p>

        <p>
          Since our custom <code>Dataset</code> is a subclass of{" "}

        <p>
          Now letâ€™s explore some other ways we can transform our image data.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Other forms of transforms (data augmentation)</h2>
        <p>
          We've seen a couple of transforms on our data already, but there are
          many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can check them out in the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html"
            target="_blank"
          >
            torchvision.transforms documentation
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          Transforms alter your images in different ways. This could mean
          converting images into tensors (as weâ€™ve seen), cropping, randomly
          erasing portions, or rotating them.
        </p>

        <p>These transformations are often part of data augmentation.</p>

        <p>
          Data augmentation increases the diversity of your training set by
          artificially altering the data. This helps the model generalize
          better, meaning it can make more robust predictions on unseen data.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more examples of data augmentation using torchvision.transforms,
          check out PyTorchâ€™s{" "}
          <a

            Illustration of Transforms
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>Now, letâ€™s try one out ourselves.</p>

        <p>
          In machine learning, we harness randomness, and research shows that
          random transforms (like transforms.RandAugment() and
          transforms.TrivialAugmentWide()) often perform better than hand-picked
          ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept behind TrivialAugment is simple: randomly pick a set of
          transforms and apply them at a random magnitude (higher magnitude
          means more intense effects). The PyTorch team used TrivialAugment to
          train their state-of-the-art vision models.
        </p>

        <img src={graph} className="centered-image" />
        <p>
          TrivialAugment was one of the key components in a recent upgrade to
          various state-of-the-art PyTorch vision models.
        </p>

        <p>Now, how about testing it out on some of our own images?</p>

        <p>
          The key parameter to focus on in{" "}
          <code>transforms.TrivialAugmentWide()</code> is{" "}
          <code>num_magnitude_bins=31</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This parameter defines how much of a range an intensity value will be
          picked to apply a certain transform. A value of 0 means no range,
          while 31 means the maximum range, giving the highest chance for the
          most intense transformations.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can easily incorporate <code>transforms.TrivialAugmentWide()</code>{" "}
          into <code>transforms.Compose()</code>.
        </p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`from torchvision import transforms

train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.TrivialAugmentWide(num_magnitude_bins=31), # how intense 
    transforms.ToTensor() # use ToTensor() last to get everything between 0 & 1
])

# Don't need to perform augmentation on the test data
test_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)), 
    transforms.ToTensor()
])`}
        />

        <div className="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong>You usually don't perform data augmentation on
          the test set. The idea of data augmentation is to to artificially
          increase the diversity of the training set to better predict on the
          testing set. However, you do need to make sure your test set images
          are transformed to tensors. We size the test images to the same size
          as our training images too, however, inference can be done on
          different size images if necessary (though this may alter
          performance).
        </div>
        <p>
          Beautiful! Now, we've got our training transform (with data
          augmentation) and test transform (without data augmentation).

          <strong>Note:</strong> One of the ways to speed up deep learning

          in the forward() method in our model above, instead of calling a layer
          block and reassigning x every time, we call each block in succession
          (see the final line of the forward() method in the model above for an
          example). This saves the time spent reassigning x (memory heavy) and
          focuses on only computing on x. See Making Deep Learning Go Brrrr From

        <h2>7.3 Try a forward pass on a single image (to test the model)</h2>

        <p>
          A good way to test a model is by performing a forward pass on a single
          piece of data.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also a useful method for testing the input and output shapes of

          You can run the cell above multiple times, with each run predicting a

        <p>You'll likely notice that the predictions are often incorrect.</p>

        <p>
          This is expected because the model hasn't been trained yet and is
          essentially making guesses using random weights.

        <p>Nice!</p>

        <p>
          The output of <code>torchinfo.summary()</code> provides a lot of
          information about our model.
        </p>

        <p>
          It includes the total number of parameters in the model (
          <code>Total params</code>), as well as the estimated total size (in
          MB), which indicates the size of the model.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also see how the input and output shapes change as data with a
          given <code>input_size</code> moves through the model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, the number of parameters and the total model size are low.
        </p>

        <p>This is because we're starting with a small model.</p>

        <p>If we need to increase its size later, we can.</p>

        <h2>7.5 Create train & test loop function</h2>
        <p>We've got data and a model.</p>

        <p>
          Now, let's create training and test loop functions to train the model
          on the training data and evaluate it on the testing data.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure we can reuse these loops, we'll turn them into functions.
        </p>

        <p>Specifically, we will define three functions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>train_step()</code> â€“ takes a model, a DataLoader, a loss
            function, and an optimizer to train the model on the DataLoader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>test_step()</code> â€“ takes a model, a DataLoader, and a loss
            function to evaluate the model on the DataLoader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>train()</code> â€“ combines the above two steps for a specified
            number of epochs and returns a results dictionary.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Let's start by building the <code>train_step()</code> function.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we're working with batches from the DataLoader, we'll accumulate
          the model's loss and accuracy values during training (by summing them
          up for each batch) and then adjust them at the end before returning
          the results.
        </p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`def train_step(model: torch.nn.Module,

        y_pred = model(X)

        # 2. Calculate  and accumulate loss
        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
        train_loss += loss.item() 

        # 3. Optimizer zero grad
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # 4. Loss backward
        loss.backward()

        # 5. Optimizer step
        optimizer.step()

        # Calculate and accumulate accuracy metrics across all batches
        y_pred_class = torch.argmax(torch.softmax(y_pred, dim=1), dim=1)
        train_acc += (y_pred_class == y).sum().item()/len(y_pred)

    # Adjust metrics to get average loss and accuracy per batch 
    train_loss = train_loss / len(dataloader)
    train_acc = train_acc / len(dataloader)
    return train_loss, train_acc`}
        />
        <p>
          Woohoo! The <code>train_step()</code> function is done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, let's do the same for the <code>test_step()</code> function.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main difference here is that the <code>test_step()</code> won't
          take an optimizer and therefore won't perform gradient descent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since we'll be doing inference, we'll ensure to use the{" "}
          <code>torch.inference_mode()</code> context manager when making
          predictions.

        <p>Specifically, it will:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Take in a model, DataLoaders for the training and test sets, an
            optimizer, a loss function, and the number of epochs for each train
            and test step.
          </li>
          <li>

          From the printouts of our <code>model_0</code> training, it didnâ€™t
          seem to perform very well.
        </p>

        <p>
          But we can further evaluate it by plotting the model's loss curves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loss curves display the model's results over time and are a great way
          to observe how the model performs on different datasets (e.g.,
          training and test).

        <p>Looks like things are all over the place...</p>

        <p>
          But we kind of knew that because our model's printout results during
          training didnâ€™t show much promise.
        </p>

        <p>
          You could try training the model for longer and see what happens when
          you plot the loss curve over a longer time horizon.
        </p>

        <h2>8. What should an ideal loss curve look like?</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at training and test loss curves is a great way to check if
          your model is overfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          An overfitting model performs much better (often by a considerable
          margin) on the training set than on the validation/test set.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your training loss is significantly lower than your test loss, your
          model is overfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means it's learning the patterns in the training data too well,
          but those patterns aren't generalizing to the test data.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, if both your training and test losses are not as
          low as you'd like, the model is considered underfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ideal situation is for the training and test loss curves to
          closely align with each other.
        </p>
        <img src={fitting} className="centered-image" />
        <p>
          <strong>Left:</strong> If your training and test loss curves aren't as
          low as you'd like, this is considered underfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Middle:</strong> When your test/validation loss is higher than
          your training loss, this is considered overfitting.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Right:</strong> The ideal scenario is when your training and
          test loss curves line up over time. This means your model is
          generalizing well.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are more combinations and different things loss curves can show.

        <h2>8.1 How to deal with overfitting</h2>
        <p>
          Since the main problem with overfitting is that your model is fitting
          the training data too well, you'll want to use techniques to "reign it
          in."
        </p>

        <p>A common technique for preventing overfitting is regularization.</p>

        <p>
          I like to think of this as "making our models more regular," meaning
          they become capable of fitting more kinds of data.
        </p>

        <p>Letâ€™s discuss a few methods to prevent overfitting.</p>

              </td>
              <td>
                Having more data gives the model more opportunities to learn
                patterns, which may be more generalizable to new examples.
              </td>

                <strong>Simplify your model</strong>
              </td>
              <td>
                If the current model is already overfitting the training data,
                it may be too complicated. This means itâ€™s learning the patterns
                of the data too well and isnâ€™t able to generalize well to unseen
                data. One way to simplify a model is to reduce the number of
                layers or reduce the number of hidden units in each layer.

              <td>
                Data augmentation manipulates the training data in a way that
                makes it harder for the model to memorize, as it artificially
                adds more variety to the data. If a model is able to learn
                patterns in augmented data, it may be able to generalize better
                to unseen data.

                Transfer learning involves leveraging the patterns (also called
                pretrained weights) one model has learned to use as the
                foundation for your own task. For example, we could use a
                computer vision model pretrained on a large variety of images
                and then tweak it to be more specialized for food images.

              <td>
                Dropout layers randomly remove connections between hidden layers
                in neural networks, effectively simplifying a model and making
                the remaining connections more robust. See{" "}

              <td>
                The idea here is to slowly decrease the learning rate as the
                model trains. This is akin to reaching for a coin at the back of
                a couch: the closer you get, the smaller your steps. Similarly,
                as you get closer to convergence, youâ€™ll want your weight
                updates to be smaller.

              </td>
              <td>
                Early stopping stops model training before it begins to overfit.
                For example, if the model's loss has stopped decreasing for the
                past 10 epochs (this number is arbitrary), you might want to
                stop the training and use the model weights from 10 epochs
                prior, which had the lowest loss.

          There are more methods for dealing with overfitting, but these are

        <p>
          As you start to build more and more deep models, you'll find that deep
          learning models are very good at learning patterns in data. As a
          result, dealing with overfitting becomes one of the primary challenges
          in deep learning.

        <h2>8.2 How to deal with underfitting</h2>
        <p>
          When a model is underfitting, it is considered to have poor predictive
          power on both the training and test sets.
        </p>

        <p>
          In essence, an underfitting model will fail to reduce the loss values
          to a desired level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, looking at our current loss curves, I would consider our
          TinyVGG model, model_0, to be underfitting the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main idea behind dealing with underfitting is to increase your
          model's predictive power.
        </p>

        <p>There are several ways to do this.</p>

                If your model is underfitting, it may not have enough capability
                to learn the required patterns, weights, or representations of
                the data to be predictive. One way to add more predictive power
                to your model is to increase the number of hidden layers/units
                within those layers.

                learning anything. In this case, you might lower the learning

                Your model might be underfitting because you're trying to
                prevent overfitting too much. Reducing the use of regularization
                techniques can help your model fit the data better.

        <h2>8.3 The balance between overfitting and underfitting</h2>
        <p>
          None of the methods discussed above are silver bullets, meaning they
          don't always work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Preventing overfitting and underfitting is possibly the most active
          area of machine learning research. Everyone wants their models to fit
          better (less underfitting) but not so well that they don't generalize
          well and perform in the real world (less overfitting).
        </p>

        <p>
          There's a fine line between overfitting and underfitting, as too much
          of each can cause the other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Transfer learning is perhaps one of the most powerful techniques for
          dealing with both overfitting and underfitting in your problems.
          Instead of handcrafting different overfitting and underfitting
          techniques, transfer learning allows you to take a pre-trained model
          from a similar problem space (such as one from{" "}

        <p>Hmm...</p>

        <p>It doesn't look like our model performed very well again.</p>

        <p>Let's check out its loss curves.</p>
        <h2>9.4 Plot the loss curves of Model 1</h2>
        <p>
          Since we've got the results of model_1 saved in a results dictionary,
          model_1_results, we can plot them using plot_loss_curves().
        </p>
        <CodeIOBlock inputCode={`plot_loss_curves(model_1_results)`} />

        <img src={lossplot} className="centered-image" />
        <p>Wow...</p>

        <p>These don't look very good either...</p>

        <p>Is our model underfitting or overfitting?</p>

        <p>Or both?</p>

        <p>
          Ideally, we'd like it to have higher accuracy and lower loss, right?
        </p>

        <p>What are some methods you could try to use to achieve these?</p>
        <h2>10. Compare model results</h2>

        <p>
          Even though our models are performing poorly, we can still compare
          them with code.
        </p>

        <p>First, letâ€™s turn our model results into pandas DataFrames.</p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`import pandas as pd
model_0_df = pd.DataFrame(model_0_results)

        />

        <p>
          And now we can write some plotting code using <code>matplotlib</code>{" "}
          to visualize the results of <code>model_0</code> and{" "}

        <p>
          It looks like our models both performed equally poorly and were kind
          of sporadic (the metrics go up and down sharply).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you built <code>model_2</code>, what would you do differently to
          try and improve performance?
        </p>

        <h2>11. Make a prediction on a custom image</h2>

        <p>
          If you've trained a model on a certain dataset, chances are you'd like
          to make a prediction on your own custom data.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our case, since we've trained a model on <code>pizza</code>,{" "}
          <code>steak</code> and <code>sushi</code> images, how could we use our
          model to make a prediction on one of our own images?
        </p>

        <p>
          To do so, we can load an image and then preprocess it in a way that
          matches the type of data our model was trained on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words, we'll have to convert our own custom image to a{" "}
          <code>tensor</code> and make sure it's in the right datatype before
          passing it to our model.
        </p>

        <p>Let's start by downloading a custom image.</p>

        <p>
          Since our model predicts whether an image contains <code>pizza</code>,{" "}
          <code>steak</code> or <code>sushi</code>, let's download a photo of my
          Dad giving two thumbs up to a big pizza from the Learn PyTorch for
          Deep Learning GitHub.
        </p>

        <p>
          We download the image using Python's <code>requests</code> module.
        </p>

        <div className="note">

        </p>

          Nice! Looks like our image is in <code>tensor</code> format, however,
          is this image format compatible with our model?

        <p>
          Our <code>custom_image</code> tensor is of datatype{" "}
          <code>torch.uint8</code> and its values are between{" "}
          <code>[0, 255]</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          But our model takes image tensors of datatype{" "}
          <code>torch.float32</code> and with values between <code>[0, 1]</code>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          So before we use our custom image with our model, we'll need to
          convert it to the same format as the data our model is trained on.

        <p>Oh wait...</p>

        <p>There's one dimension we forgot about.</p>

        <p>
          The <code>batch size</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our model expects image tensors with a <code>batch size</code>{" "}
          dimension at the start (<code>NCHW</code> where <code>N</code> is the
          batch size).
        </p>

        <p>
          Except our <code>custom image</code> is currently only{" "}
          <code>CHW</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can add a <code>batch size</code> dimension using{" "}
          <code>torch.unsqueeze(dim=0)</code> to add an extra dimension to our
          image and finally make a prediction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Essentially we'll be telling our model to predict on a single image

          <strong>Note:</strong>
          What we've just gone through are three of the classical and most

          device - our model was on the target device (in our case, the GPU)
          whereas our target data hadn't been moved to the target device yet.
          Wrong shapes - our model expected an input image of shape [N, C, H, W]
          or [batch_size, color_channels, height, width] whereas our custom
          image tensor was of shape [color_channels, height, width]. Keep in
          mind, these errors aren't just for predicting on custom images. They

        <p>Alright!</p>

        <p>Looking good.</p>

        <p>
          But of course our <code>prediction label</code> is still in
          index/tensor form.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can convert it to a <code>string class name prediction</code> by
          indexing on the <code>class_names</code> list.
        </p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`# Find the predicted label
custom_image_pred_class = class_names[custom_image_pred_label.cpu()] # put pred label to CPU, otherwise will error
custom_image_pred_class`}
          outputCode={`'pizza'`}
        />
        <p>Wow.</p>

        <p>
          It looks like the <code>model</code> gets the <code>prediction</code>{" "}
          right, even though it was performing poorly based on our{" "}
          <code>evaluation metrics</code>.
        </p>
        <div className="note">
          <strong>Note:</strong> The model in its current form will predict
          "pizza", "steak" or "sushi" no matter what image it's given. If you
          wanted your model to predict on a different class, you'd have to train
          it to do so.
        </div>
        <p>
          But if we check the <code>custom_image_pred_probs</code>, we'll notice
          that the <code>model</code> gives almost equal weight (the values are
          similar) to every <code>class</code>.
        </p>

        <CodeIOBlock
          inputCode={`# The values of the prediction probabilities are quite similar
custom_image_pred_probs`}
          outputCode={`tensor([[0.3738, 0.3378, 0.2883]], device='cuda:0')`}
        />

        <p>
          Having prediction probabilities this similar could mean a couple of
          things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The <code>model</code> is trying to predict all three{" "}
            <code>classes</code> at the same time (there may be an{" "}
            <code>image</code> containing <code>pizza</code>, <code>steak</code>{" "}
            and <code>sushi</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>model</code> doesn't really know what it wants to predict
            and is in turn just assigning similar values to each of the{" "}
            <code>classes</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Our case is number 2, since our <code>model</code> is poorly trained,
          it is basically guessing the <code>prediction</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>
          11.3 Putting custom image prediction together: building a function
        </h2>

        <p>
          Doing all of the above steps every time you'd like to make a{" "}
          <code>prediction</code> on a custom <code>image</code> would quickly
          become tedious.
        </p>

        <p>
          So let's put them all together in a function we can easily use over
          and over again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specifically, let's make a <code>function</code> that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Takes in a target <code>image path</code> and converts to the right
            datatype for our <code>model</code> (<code>torch.float32</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Makes sure the target <code>image</code> pixel values are in the
            range <code>[0, 1]</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transforms the target <code>image</code> if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Makes sure the <code>model</code> is on the target{" "}
            <code>device</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Makes a <code>prediction</code> on the target <code>image</code>{" "}
            with a trained <code>model</code> (ensuring the <code>image</code>{" "}
            is the right size and on the same <code>device</code> as the{" "}
            <code>model</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Converts the <code>model</code>'s output <code>logits</code> to{" "}
            <code>prediction probabilities</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Converts the <code>prediction probabilities</code> to{" "}
            <code>prediction labels</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plots the target <code>image</code> alongside the{" "}
            <code>model prediction</code> and{" "}
            <code>prediction probability</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>A fair few steps but we've got this!</p>

        <p>Two thumbs up again!</p>

        <p>
          Looks like our <code>model</code> got the <code>prediction</code>{" "}
          right just by guessing.
        </p>

        <p>
          This won't always be the case with other <code>images</code> though...
        </p>

        <p>
          The <code>image</code> is pixelated too because we resized it to{" "}
          <code>[64, 64]</code> using <code>custom_image_transform</code>.

        <h2>Main takeaways</h2>
        <p>We've covered a fair bit in this module.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            PyTorch has many in-built functions to deal with all kinds of data,
            from vision to text to audio to recommendation systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            If PyTorch's built-in data loading functions don't suit your
            requirements, you can write code to create your own custom datasets
            by subclassing <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>torch.utils.data.DataLoader</code>'s in PyTorch help turn your
            Dataset's into iterables that can be used when training and testing
            a model.
          </li>
          <li>
            A lot of machine learning is dealing with the balance between
            overfitting and underfitting (we discussed different methods for
            each above, so a good exercise would be to research more and write
            code to try out the different techniques).
          </li>
          <li>
            Predicting on your own custom data with a trained model is possible,
            as long as you format the data into a similar format to what the
            model was trained on. Make sure you take care of the three big
            PyTorch and deep learning errors:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Wrong datatypes - Your model expected <code>torch.float32</code>{" "}
                when your data is <code>torch.uint8</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wrong data shapes - Your model expected{" "}
                <code>[batch_size, color_channels, height, width]</code> when
                your data is <code>[color_channels, height, width]</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wrong devices - Your model is on the GPU but your data is on the
                CPU.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
